# Notes / Philosophy

## UI design

Don't tell ppl what everything is. Entice exploration. Show the options and ppl
will want to play with them to see what they do.

Don't teach ppl any "game meta", only how to use the basic mechanics. Let ppl
discover their own play style.

UI should be visually intuitive, easy to control with different input devices.

## Input devices

Touch > Mouse+Kbd > Gamepad
