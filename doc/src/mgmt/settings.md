# Game Settings

Here we keep track of all the ideas for what aspects of the game should be
customizable and exposed in the game's settings.

These are just ideas to explore, not a plan to commit to. Some of these might
never be implemented.

## Camera Behavior

 - Screen Shake: on/off
 - Jump tweening transition duration
 - Move camera on screen edge

## Gameplay Behavior

 - Show region highlight:
   - based on cursor location
   - based on camera location

## UI

 - Show minimap: on/off
 - City UI:
   - Floating
   - Sidebar

## Control Scheme

### Mouse/Keyboard

// TODO

### Touchscreen

// TODO

## Accessibility Options

### Flashbang Alternatives

Allow changing the white flashbang to black or a custom color.

### Colorblindness: color remapping

Allow selecting a custom color for each of the up-to-6 players in a match.

Should allow tweaking colors completely, selecting both a bright and dim shade for each player.

Should ideally have a UI color picker and a preview render to see what it looks like in context.

### Colorblindness: tile patterns

Provide "patterned" alternatives which could be used instead of the base flat color tile.
