# Monetization Ideas

This page describes various monetization ideas that could be implemented for MineWars.

## Premium Accounts

Players could purchase an upgraded account that unlocks extra features that
are intended for more competitive players who are more serious about the game.

This may include:
 - features that help you improve your skills
 - options that help you avoid players who are cheating
 - â€¦

It could be marketed with some language that appeals to competitive players, like:
"Pro Competition Upgrade" or something.

It could offer features like:

### Replay History

Non-premium players can only download a replay of the game they just played,
at the end of each game. The server will not store replays.

Premium players could have replays of their past games stored with their
account for later retrieval.

There could also be an option to get a link/code for sharing a replay to let
other people watch it.

### Premium-only Online Multiplayer

Have the option of filtering the online multiplayer game mode, to only play
with other premium players. This should reduce the likelihood of encountering
cheaters.

### Spectator Visibility Settings

Decide whether you want to be visible to spectators in online games.

Unlocks new preferences in the game settings, like:
 - Anyone can see me (default for non-premium players)
 - Only my friends can see me
 - Nobody can see me
 - Manual Whitelist
 - In-game toggle and confirmation

(just examples of the possibilities)

If you reduce or disable your visibility to spectators, you can be confident
that untrusted players cannot cheat/ghost by abusing the spectator view.
