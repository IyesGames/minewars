# Overview

MineWars is a multiplayer real-time strategy game, inspired by Minesweeper and
Civilization. Players battle for territory and control over cities. Players
can deploy their own mines, cause chain explosions, and avoid enemy mines
using Minesweeper-like digit hints. The objective is to eliminate other players
by capturing all their cities.
