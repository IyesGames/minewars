# Overview

MineWars is a multiplayer real-time strategy game, inspired by Minesweeper and
Civilization. Players battle for territory and control over cities. The objective
of the game is to eliminate other players by capturing their cities.

PvP confrontations happen via Minesweeper-like gameplay. Players place mines and
other items on their own territory to defend it and challenge their opponents.
They see digits hinting at the locations of enemy items.

There is an in-game economy. Cities accumulate money based on the territory
the player owns, which the player can spend to deploy items, build infrastructure,
or perform offensive attacks.

A good MineWars player knows how to strategically build their empire: manage
their economy and build infrastructure to set themselves up for success. They
can make good use of the map's varied geography. They can also out-Minesweeper
their opponents in the raw fight for territory.
