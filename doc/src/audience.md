# Target Audience

Who is this game for? What makes it fun and appealing?

## Game Appeal

### Intense Time Pressure and Conflict

Intense fast-paced high-pressure gameplay.

You have to be constantly engaged and making decisions, be good at managing
your time and attention. Be fast and decisive.

Every second is an **opportunity cost**. If you are not doing something useful,
you are falling behind other players. If you make good decisions quickly,
you pull ahead.

You are racing for domination.

### Gameplay Variety

Large variety of interconnected game mechanics give multi-dimensional gameplay.
The game mechanics fit well together and have cross-cutting implications.

Every decision has consequences. You are constantly considering your
opportunity cost – making trade-offs about where to invest your time
and attention.

### Emotional Moments
 
Emotional tension from facing the consequences of your mistakes and poor
decisions.

Emotional reward from making good decisions that pay off, and from exploiting
the mistakes and vulnerabilities of other players.

### Skill-Based Progression

You get better at the game as you play more. Your skill and experience are
the primary things that determine your success, not chance (and certainly
not pay-to-win).

The gameplay effects due to the randomness of the procedurally-generated map
and spawn location are quickly dwarfed by the consequences of your skills
and decisions.

#### Macro Play

As you become more experienced, you reduce your cognitive overhead. You
become more decisive with your actions.

Build intuition and instincts for how to react to different situations. What
game mechanics to focus your attention on. How to adapt to the map's geography.

Learn how to plan well for the progression of the game and set yourself up
for success.

#### Micro Play

Get good at parsing the Minesweeper digits. Glance at the screen and instantly
know what to do, where to click.

Get good at your defense game. Know effective mine/decoy formations and
quickly deploy them appropriately to the situation.

### Infinite Replayability

The procedurally-generated map guarantees that every game is a unique
experience.

Learn to navigate the unique geography of each particular map and your spawn
position in it.

Also, competitive PvP games are replayable by nature …

### Social Dynamics

… your opponents are other humans that also learn and get more skilled,
and everyone has their own unique playstyle.

Play psychological mind-games with your opponent.

[Alliances Extension](/ideas.md#alliances) may greatly expand the scope for this.

## Different Audiences

The highly-determined competitive strategy player is the primary target of this game.

(TODO) Think about if we can do something to make this game more appealing also to more casual players.

### Spectating Experience

Such a game is likely to also be engaging to watch, not just play.

There is a whole separate e-sports-like potential audience for this game.

Some people may be more interested in spectating and analyzing the matches
of skilled players, rather than playing the game themselves.

Offering good spectator and replay experiences can provide a lot of value
to the community.

Being able to watch offline replays, not just live matches, is also a valuable
tool for analyzing matches and learning from prior experiences. Game replay
and analysis features would be valuable to both spectator/analyst and to
player audiences.

### Who do you play against?

The playerbase could also be categorized based on who they most likely want to play with.

Some players may prefer to play against their friends. They may prefer a LAN session.

Some players may prefer to play against strangers. They may prefer online matchmaking.

Some players may prefer to play with a semi-restricted number of people on a community server.

To cover the widest possible audience, the game should strive to offer all of these server/session kinds.
