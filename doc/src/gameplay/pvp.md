# PvP Combat

Player encounters happen on "front lines"; that is, when your territory reaches
that of another player.

You can try to capture another player's territory, just like you do neutral land
at the start of the game.

Everyone is incentivised to set up defenses by deploying items and building
structures on their territory, to protect themselves from other players
advancing into it.

Similarly, everyone is incentivised to attack and advance into other
territories, in their attempt to play towards the game's overall objective:
eliminating the other players.

## Digits

Every player-owned tile will show a Minesweeper-like **Digit**, to indicate the
total number of **Items** on adjacent tiles not owned by the player.

Further, an **Asterisk** (*) will be displayed with the digit, if there are any
**Decoys**. The player can use this hint/information to figure out where decoys
might be and decide if they want to try and risk stepping on those tiles.

The game client can provide a feature to switch digits to "enemy preview" mode,
where the other players' digits are displayed instead, to allow the player
to visualize how their defensive item formations would be seen by others.

## Defensive Play Overview

When you own territory, you do not want to leave it undefended and easy to capture.
Also, remember, if a player clicks on a "known safe" tile (with no digit), they
can capture large swaths of territory in a single click!

Therefore, as you gain new territory, you want to set up formations of defensive
**Items** to protect it. The presence of items will stop an invader's expansion
and force them to solve a Minesweeper digit puzzle.

It is very important to use creative and clever formations of defensive items
(mines, flashbangs), decoys, and empty tiles, in order to create a challenging
Minesweeper puzzle for the other player. The more variety, the better. For
example, using too many items without leaving empty tiles will make the digits
very easy to figure out. Ditto for not using decoys.

At the front line itself, you need to be especially careful. Deploying some
additional items in real-time can be helpful to confuse the opponent, if they
are actively trying to invade.

You can use **Smokes** to conceal specific digits for the enemy. This gives you
an opportunity to deploy your items without immediately giving away information
about what you are doing.

If you have a large territory, you might have multiple fronts, possibly with
multiple other players. You need to keep an eye on all of them.

Further, you can build **Structures** within your territory. Barricades allow you
to make use of geography (mountain clusters) to limit mobility and make it
difficult for a future invader to advance into key locations. Watch Towers
will give you visibility in case you lose the surrounding territory, and reveal
nearby enemy items.

## Offensive Play Overview

At the front line, you might decide to attack and advance into enemy territory.

To do this, you need to solve the Minesweeper puzzle. Use the digits to figure
out where enemy items are, and determine what tiles are safe to step on.

Logically, there are three possibilities for any given enemy tile:
 - Empty (no item): does not count towards digits
 - Safe Item (decoy): counts towards digits, but makes them display an asterisk (*)
 - Dangerous Item (mine, flashbang): counts towards digits

You want to avoid dangerous items, and step on tiles that are safe (empty or
decoy). Decoys make the puzzle more challenging: you need to account for them
when you mentally parse the digits + asterisks.

If you need information quickly, you can use the **Reveal** action (which costs a
lot of money), to immediately learn what is on an enemy tile.

If you think you know where dangerous items is located, you have options for dealing with them:
 - **Strike** the tiles (offensive action), causing explosions that destroy the item and the land it stands on. Costs money.
 - Carefully surround the items by stepping on adjacent safe tiles, **capturing** them. Rewards you with money.
 - Just step on the tile anyway and suffer the consequences. ;) Probably best reserved for dire situations.

This presents an interesting tradeoff:

If you value your time and have money, you can play quickly and recklessly,
striking enemy tiles to destroy items. You can be even more reckless and just
strike enemy tiles, regardless of whether you think there is an item there, and
not even bothering with the Minesweeper puzzle. This costs even more money and
will destroy a lot of land, removing valuable natural resources.

On the other hand, if you want to take your time to play carefully and methodically,
solving the Minesweeper puzzle can allow you to capture the enemy items. This way,
you don't spend any money on your invasion. In fact, you gain money as a reward
for the items you find. You also do no damage to the natural resources on the map.
