# Server Admin Handbook

This chapter is a guide to hosting MineWars game servers.

We believe in the power of community. One of our development goals for
the project is to embrace that and provide rich support for unofficial
game servers. Here you can learn how to set up your own.

Everything you need is distributed with your standard game install.
You will find all the files necessary alongside the game's executable,
wherever it is installed on your computer.
