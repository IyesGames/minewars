# Tutorial and Examples

You can find the Host server executable alongside the game client executable
in your game's install folder. It is called `mw_hostsrv`.

Open a terminal and run it from the command-line. You need to specify the
config file. There are some example config files in the `cfg/examples/` folder.

```sh
./mw_hostsrv --config cfg/examples/simple.toml
```
