# Gameplay and Rules

Note: everything subject to change, as we play-test and balance the game.

Note: many of the concepts are interconnected; by necessity, this document
cannot introduce them in isolation, and each section may refer to concepts
not yet explained (if you are reading in order).

## Gameplay Objective

In MineWars, a number of players compete for ownership over **cities**
and **territory**.

There are a number of **cities** in various locations on the map. Each
player begins the game with one **starting city**.

A player must own *at least one city* at all times; otherwise is eliminated
from the game. The objective of the game is to eliminate other players.

## Game Over Condition

### Lose

If a player loses the last city they own, they are out of the game. All
territory they own becomes neutral. They may continue to spectate the game.

### Win

If a player is the last one standing, they are the winner of the game.

## Score

During the game, there can be a scoreboard allowing players to judge the progress
through the game, based on their (and other players') stats.

The most important number is the "cities owned". It indicates the size of each
player's empire. All players must know the status of all cities at all times.
Their locations and owners are visible, even behind fog of war. There can be a
mini-scoreboard on-screen at all times, showing the number of cities for each
player in the match.

Additionally, players can bring up a detailed scoreboard, which provides more
stats. Some example things we can include:
 - "Kills": number of times another player has stepped on a player's mine
 - "Deaths": number of times the player has stepped on another player's mine
 - "Captures": number of times the player has captured a city
